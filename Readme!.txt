Hi everyone,

This is my second Evermight assignment. This one uses pure CSS and HTML to create a responsive webpage. I was given this assignment on Friday night of June 23,
but with a midterm on Saturday, Pride parade on Sunday, Midterm on Tuesday and Midterm on Thursday, it was a bit hard for time.

By Monday though, I read through all of responsive CSS, viewports and animations. I did not use any @webkit, instead using transitions and @media queries to clear transitions
when needed. I read somewhere that plan for phone viewport as the default, so most of my CSS code defaults to the smallest viewport with @media queries for bigger viewports.
There are few actual functionalities for this page; everything is style. The design of this website came down to three parts: navigation menu, title page and results grid. 
I finished the navigation menu by Wednesday night, and on Thursday night I worked on the results grid animation, positioning and more.

It took me a while trying to figure out absolute/relative/static/fixed positioning, but I soon found out the usefulness z-index Finally I ACheckered my webpage with temperary
internal CSS and corrected the few mistakes I had. Finally, I split my .css file into three distinct parts, one for each part of the webpage, and put everything in neat
folders. I honestly was not sure if the webpage should be split by viewport, but I find that not splitting by viewport saves a lot more coding. 

I have given a heads-up to the supervisors that they can expect this assignment by Thursday, Friday at the latest. Unfortunately, I did not make it for Thursday. 

Anyways, enjoy this assignment and constructive criticisms welcome!
